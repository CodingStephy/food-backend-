# MERN Lab

Get ready to build your first MERN app! For this lab, your goal is to build a
simple MERN app with Express on the back-end and React on the front-end. Your
app should have one and only one model!

## Prerequisites

- Mongo, Mongoose, Express and Node
- React, Components, State and Props
- React Component Lifecycle Methods (useEffect)
- React Router

## Instructions

1.  Fork and Clone this repo
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.
1.  Post an issue on this repository with links to your repo(s).

Unlike most labs, for this one you will submit your work by **making a pull request**. If a pull request has not been performed up until now then the instructor will walk the class through performing one at the completion of this readme.


Use this repo to include both the frontend and backend servers. The frontend server should be placed in a folder named **client** and the backend server should be created at the root of this repo. 

## Requirements

Build a simple MERN app! Keep it very simple: only 1 model with full CRUD.

Your app should have a back-end build with Express that persists data to a
MongoDB database using Mongoose. Your Express app should return JSON data to
your React front-end.

The front-end for your simple MERN app should be built with React. Use axios to
get data from your Express back-end and pass the data through your app using
state and props. Use React Router to build out separate 'views' for creating,
editing, updating and deleting instances of your model.

Stick to just 1 model and keep it simple. The purpose of this lab is to practice
working with Express and React. Your goal should be to have full CRUD functionality on one
model with a React front-end and Express back-end.

## Bonus

Add another model as a sub-document. Finish full CRUD on your first model before
adding a subdocument. Make it so users can perform full CRUD on the
sub-document.

## Double Bonus

Deploy your app. Use heroku for the backend and surge for the frontend. 

## Pull Request Demo

The instructor will perform a run through of making a Pull Request.  This requires the repo to be forked and cloned and for at least one change be added - commited - pushed to your forked version of the repo. For this, peform an `npm init` to create a `package.json` file which you will then add-commit-push to your forked repo. 

```sh
npm init
```
